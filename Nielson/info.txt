# Example of machine learning using MNIST

As an exercise to get famaliar with machine learning a python program is created to clasify handwritten images from the MNIST data set.
The program is written such that it gives an understanding into the basics of machine learning. The program is not desinged to be fast.

The program exist out of three files: 
1: NeuralNetworkHandWrittenImage.py
2: NeuralNetworkFast.py
3: MNISTDataLoader.py

*NeuralNetworkHandWrittenImage.py* Runs the main program

*NeuralNetworkFast.py* This program creates a neural network and its training methods

*MNISTDataLoader.py* This program decodes the data files into useful format for the NeuralNetworkHandWrittenImage.py program
